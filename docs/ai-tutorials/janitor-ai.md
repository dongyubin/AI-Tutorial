## How to Set Up Janitor AI's API?

- Although Janitor AI is currently free to use, to chat with characters, you must obtain an API key.
- The API key can be an OpenAI API key or a Kobold AI API key, but these keys are not free.

Even though Janitor AI is currently free to use, if you want to chat with characters, you must obtain an API key.

An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. Janitor AI's API key can be an OpenAI API key or a Kobold AI API key. However, these keys are not free.

For example, suppose you want to chat with Kai Brown. Click on his picture, then click on Chat with Kai Brown. You will receive a reminder: "API not ready! Click to set up."

*API not ready*

You have 3 options to obtain an API key. They are OpenAI API key, OpenAI Proxy, and Kobold AI API key. **I will take the example of OpenAI API key to show you the process of setting up the API.**

### Using OpenAI API Key

OpenAI is not free. They offer a $5 trial, which is equivalent to about 500 messages. So, if you want to use Janitor AI for free, you can only chat with character bots up to 500 messages.

If you see errors about quotas or billing, this means you have used up the $5 trial limit of OpenAI. After that, you will need to pay OpenAI to use their API.

**Note:** This key is only stored on your local device and is never sent to the server.

Here is a step-by-step guide to obtaining an API from OpenAI:

1. Register or log in to your [OpenAI](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login) account.
2. Click on **Profile** at the top right corner of the screen.
3. Click on **API Keys**.
4. Click on **Create New Key**.
5. Name your new key and click **Create New Key** again to obtain your API.

![OpenAI Click to Create New Key](https://usacdn.wangdu.site/file/blog-cdn/WP-CDN-02/2024/202405071729482.png)

OpenAI proxies are contributed by the community. However, they may be slow or unstable, and sometimes you may get strange results.

In addition to using Janitor AI as a basic online chatbot through the website interface, you can also integrate it into your projects using the provided API and developer resources.

For developers or businesses looking to integrate Janitor AI into their projects or platforms, the process involves a few additional steps:

1. **API Integration:** It starts with integrating Janitor AI into the desired platform or application using the provided API or software development kits (SDKs).
2. **Training the Model:** After you have added Janitor AI, you need to train it with appropriate datasets and conversation logs. This step is crucial for the chatbot to understand and respond better. The more suitable the training data, the better the chatbot will perform.

- **Data Analysis:** Train Janitor AI to look at data and provide you with useful insights. This is helpful in projects where you need to understand data and make decisions based on it. Janitor AI can help you find important information in large datasets and assist you in making data-based decisions.

## Limitations of Janitor AI

- **Lack of Emotional Intelligence:** Despite its excellent performance in natural language processing (NLP), Janitor AI is essentially still an AI model. Therefore, it may not fully grasp or respond to the emotional subtleties typically present in human interactions. While it can effectively process and reply to text inputs, recognizing user emotions or expressing empathy is beyond its capabilities.
- **Inability to Handle Complex Queries:** Janitor AI may struggle with complex or ambiguous questions that require a deeper level of understanding or analysis. If a question has many parts or is quite tricky, due to programming and training limitations, the chatbot may not be able to provide a good answer.
- **NSFW Content:** Users should be aware that Janitor AI allows certain content that may not be suitable for the workplace (NSFW).
- **Inability to Handle Unfamiliar Scenarios:** The performance of Janitor AI largely depends on its training. If it encounters new or unexpected situations that were not covered in its training, it may have difficulty responding correctly. Although it can learn and adjust over time, it is not guaranteed to manage every unexpected situation well.

## Final Evaluation

Janitor AI is an interesting tool that allows you to easily chat with a range of characters, making your day more enjoyable and less boring. However, it does contain a considerable amount of NSFW content, so it is not the best choice for professional content creation. If you are looking for accurate and professional responses, trying the GPT 4.0 version might be better.
